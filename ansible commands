To see all connected nodes information type below command in ansible master node

   ansible all -i myhosts -m setup
To install webserver on both redhat and ubuntu nodes by using single play book we use condition base :

like when: ansible_os_family == "Debian"   for ubuntu node
     when: ansible_os_family == "RedHat"   for RedHat node
To seerequired node information type below command in ansible master node

sai@ip-172-31-27-92:~/Ansible-SAI_1992$ ansible all -i myhosts -m setup -a "filter=*family*"
172.31.18.211 | SUCCESS => {

        "ansible_os_family": "Debian",
        "discovered_interpreter_python": "/usr/bin/python3"
    },
    "changed": false
}

Templates & Handlers:
i want to dsiplay apache2 webpage replaced with my own content
for this before writing playbook we need to create index.j2 file with which you want from node and your matter as follows:

#<h1> This is SAI & HARISH </h1>
#<h1> Displaying i.p address of node: "{{ansible_all_ipv4_addresses}}" </h1>
#<h1> Displaying Family of particular node: "{{ansible_os_family}}"</h1>

after writing index.j2 file you will go to template.yml playbook

DYNAMIC INVENTORY:

1. create AWS admin user
   create IAM in services and create user and select check boxes and permssion and download .csv file
2. under Master >>user sai
   on Ubuntu 
   sudo apt-get install python-pip
   sudo pip install boto
3. on user sai and root
   create vi.boto (file)
   [Credentials]
   aws_access_key_id=foo 
   aws_secret_access_key= ---  (Copy paste IAM accesskey and secret key)
4.Create a AMI by using our required existing ubuntu node or redhat node
   go to ansible node actions>>create AMI and name as ubuntunodeAMI and create
   Then go to ec2 ami and it will run
     after creating AMI all data from the node will be stored
5. Create instances by using playbook (creatinginstances.yml)

for Dyanamic concepts:
search in google ec2.py, ec2.ini copy paste the data, 
 under user create two file vi ec2.py, ec2.ini and paste
 change permissions of bothfiles (chmod 755 ec2.ini, ec2.py)
to set the path for ec2.ini and ec2.py file  (under user level)
   >>>export EC2_INI_PATH=/home/sai/ec2.ini
   >>> export ANSIBLE_HOSTS=/home/sai/ec2.py

To check list of all nodes type command :
        ./ec2.py --list
    we will playbook according to the tag list.
after writing play book the new created nodes to chech pingable or not
 ansible -i ec2.py -u sai tag_Name_ansible_ubuntuNodes -m ping
  to execute a play book  

   ansible-playbook -i ec2.py -u sai dynamic-apache2.yml
